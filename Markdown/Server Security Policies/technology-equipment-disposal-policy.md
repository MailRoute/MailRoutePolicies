# Technology Equipment Disposal Policy

**Last Update Status:** *Updated August 2020*

## Overview

Technology equipment often contains parts which cannot simply be thrown
away. Proper disposal of equipment is both environmentally responsible
and often required by law. In addition, hard drives, USB drives, CD-ROMs
and other storage media contain various kinds of MailRoute data,
some of which is considered sensitive. In order to protect our
constituent's data, all storage mediums must be properly erased before
being disposed of. However, simply deleting or even formatting data is
not considered sufficient. When deleting files or formatting a device,
data is marked for deletion, but is still accessible until being
overwritten by a new file. Therefore, special tools must be used to
securely erase data prior to equipment disposal.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy it to define the guidelines for the disposal
of technology equipment and components owned by MailRoute.

## Scope

This policy applies to any computer/technology equipment or peripheral
devices that are no longer needed within MailRoute including, but
not limited to the following:Â  personal computers, servers, hard drives,

Mobile, iOS or Android-based devices), peripherals (i.e., keyboards,
mice, speakers), printers, scanners, typewriters, compact and floppy
discs, portable storage devices (i.e., USB drives), backup tapes,
printed materials.

All MailRoute employees and affiliates must comply with this
policy.
