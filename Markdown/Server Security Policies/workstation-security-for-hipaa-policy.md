# Workstation Security (For HIPAA) Policy

**Last Update Status:** *Updated August 2020*

## Overview

See Purpose.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance for workstation
security for MailRoute workstations in order to ensure the
security of information on the workstation and information the
workstation may have access to. Additionally, the policy provides
guidance to ensure the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule
"Workstation Security" Standard 164.310(c) are met.

## Scope

This policy applies to all MailRoute employees, contractors,
workforce members, vendors and agents with a MailRoute-owned or
personal-workstation connected to the MailRoute network.

## Policy

Appropriate measures must be taken when using workstations to ensure the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive information,
including protected health information (PHI) and that access to
sensitive information is restricted to authorized users.

1. Workforce members using workstations shall consider the sensitivity
of the information, including protected health information (PHI) that
may be accessed and minimize the possibility of unauthorized access.

1. MailRoute will implement physical and technical safeguards
for all workstations that access electronic protected health information
to restrict access to authorized users.

1. Appropriate measures include:

    -   Restricting physical access to workstations to only authorized
        personnel.
    
    -   Securing workstations (screen lock or logout) prior to leaving area
        to prevent unauthorized access.
    
    -   Enabling a password-protected screen saver with a short timeout
        period to ensure that workstations that were left unsecured will be
        protected. The password must comply with MailRoute *Password
        Policy*.
    
    -   Complying with all applicable password policies and procedures. See
        MailRoute *Password Policy*.
    
    -   Ensuring workstations are used for authorized business purposes
        only.
    
    -   Never installing unauthorized software on workstations.
    
    -   Storing all sensitive information, including protected health
        information (PHI) on network servers
    
    -   Keeping food and drink away from workstations in order to avoid
        accidental spills.
    
    -   Securing laptops that contain sensitive information by using cable
        locks or locking laptops up in drawers or cabinets.
    
    -   Complying with the *Portable Workstation Encryption Policy*
    
    -   Complying with the Baseline *Workstation Configuration Standard*
    
    -   Installing privacy screen filters or using other physical barriers
        to alleviate exposing data.
    
    -   Ensuring workstations are left on but logged off in order to
        facilitate after-hours updates.
    
    -   Exit running applications and close open documents
    
    -   Ensuring that all workstations use a surge protector (not just a
        power strip) or a UPS (battery backup).
    
    -   If wireless network access is used, ensure access is secure by
        following the *Wireless Communication policy*
