# Acquisition Assessment Policy

**Last Update Status:** *Updated August 2020*

## Overview

The process of integrating a newly acquired company can have a drastic
impact on the security poster of either the parent company or the child
company. The network and security infrastructure of both entities may
vary greatly and the workforce of the new company may have a drastically
different culture and tolerance to openness. The goal of the security
acquisition assessment and integration process should include:

-   Assess company's security landscape, posture, and policies

-   Protect both MailRoute and the acquired company from
    increased security risks

-   Educate acquired company about MailRoute policies and
    standard

-   Adopt and implement MailRoute Security Policies and Standards

-   Integrate acquired company

-   Continuous monitoring and auditing of the acquisition

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish Infosec responsibilities
regarding corporate acquisitions, and define the minimum security
requirements of an Infosec acquisition assessment.

## Scope

This policy applies to all companies acquired by MailRoute and
pertains to all systems, networks, laboratories, test equipment,
hardware, software and firmware, owned and/or operated by the acquired
company.

## Policy

1.  General

    Acquisition assessments are conducted to ensure that a company being
acquired by MailRoute does not pose a security risk to corporate
networks, internal systems, and/or confidential/sensitive information.
The Infosec Team will provide personnel to serve as active members of
the acquisition team throughout the entire acquisition process. The
Infosec role is to detect and evaluate information security risk,
develop a remediation plan with the affected parties for the identified
risk, and work with the acquisitions team to implement solutions for any
identified security risks, prior to allowing connectivity to MailRoute's 
networks. Below are the minimum requirements that the acquired
company must meet before being connected to the MailRoute
network.
