# Wireless Communication Policy

**Last Update Status:** *Updated August 2020*

## Overview

With the mass explosion of Smart Phones and Tablets, pervasive wireless
connectivity is almost a given at any organization. Insecure wireless
configuration can provide an easy open door for malicious threat actors.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to secure and protect the information
assets owned by MailRoute. MailRoute provides computer
devices, networks, and other electronic information systems to meet
missions, goals, and initiatives. MailRoute grants access to
these resources as a privilege and must manage them responsibly to
maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all
information assets.

This policy specifies the conditions that wireless infrastructure
devices must satisfy to connect to MailRoute network. Only those
wireless infrastructure devices that meet the standards specified
inÂ this policy or are granted an exception by the Information Security
Department are approved for connectivity to a MailRoute network.

## Scope

All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary and other workers at
MailRoute, including all personnel affiliated with third parties
that maintain a wireless infrastructure device on behalf of 
MailRoute must adhere to this policy. This policy applies to all wireless
infrastructure devices that connect to a MailRoute network or
reside on a MailRoute site that provide wireless connectivity to
endpoint devices including, but not limited to, laptops, desktops,
cellular phones, and tablets. This includes any form of wireless
communication device capable of transmitting packet data.

## Policy

1.  General Requirements

    All wireless infrastructure devices that reside at a MailRoute
site and connect to a MailRoute network, or provide access to
information classified as MailRoute Confidential, or above must:

    -   Abide by the standards specified in the Wireless Communication Standard. 

    -   Be installed, supported, and maintained by an approved support team.
    
    -   Use MailRoute approved authentication protocols and infrastructure.
    
    -   Use MailRoute approved encryption protocols.
    
    -   Maintain a hardware address (MAC address) that can be registered and tracked. 
    
    -   Not interfere with wireless access deployments maintained by other support organizations.
    
1.  Lab and Isolated Wireless Device Requirements

    All lab wireless infrastructure devices that provide access to MailRoute Confidential or above, must adhere to section 1 above. Lab and
isolated wireless devices that do not provide general network
connectivity to the MailRoute network must:

    -   Be isolated from the corporate network (that is it must not provide any corporate connectivity) and comply with the Lab Security Policy.

    -   Not interfere with wireless access deployments maintained by other support organizations. 

1.  Home Wireless Device Requirements

    -  Wireless infrastructure devices that provide direct access
       to the MailRoute corporate network, must conform to
       the Home Wireless Device Requirements as detailed in the
       *Wireless Communication Standard*.

    -  Wireless infrastructure devices that fail to conform to the
       Home Wireless Device Requirements must be installed in a
       manner that prohibits direct access to the MailRoute
       corporate network. Access to the MailRoute corporate
       network through this device must use standard remote access
       authentication.
