# Remote Access Policy

**Last Update Status:** *Updated August 2020*

## Overview

Remote access to our corporate network is essential to maintain our
Team's productivity, but in many cases this remote access originates
from networks that may already be compromised or are at a significantly
lower security posture than our corporate network. While these remote
networks are beyond the control of Hypergolic Reactions, LLC policy, we
must mitigate these external risks the best of our ability.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define rules and requirements for
connecting to MailRoute\'s network from any host. These rules and
requirements are designed to minimize the potential exposure to
MailRoute from damages which may result from unauthorized use of
MailRoute resources. Damages include the loss of sensitive or
company confidential data, intellectual property, damage to public
image, damage to critical MailRoute internal systems, and fines
or other financial liabilities incurred as a result of those losses.

## Scope

This policy applies to all MailRoute employees, contractors,
vendors and agents with a MailRoute-owned or personally-owned
computer or workstation used to connect to the MailRoute network.
This policy applies to remote access connections used to do work on
behalf of MailRoute, including reading or sending email and
viewing intranet web resources. This policy covers any and all technical
implementations of remote access used to connect to MailRoute
networks.

## Policy

It is the responsibility of MailRoute employees, contractors,
vendors and agents with remote access privileges to MailRoute\'s
corporate network to ensure that their remote access connection is given
the same consideration as the user's on-site connection to MailRoute.

General access to the Internet for recreational use through the
MailRoute network is strictly limited to MailRoute
employees, contractors, vendors and agents (hereafter referred to as
"Authorized Users"). When accessing the MailRoute network from a
personal computer, Authorized Users are responsible for preventing
access to any MailRoute computer resources or data by
non-Authorized Users. Performance of illegal activities through the
MailRoute network by any user (Authorized or otherwise) is
prohibited. The Authorized User bears responsibility for and
consequences of misuse of the Authorized User's access. For further
information and definitions, see the *Acceptable Use Policy*.

Authorized Users will not use MailRoute networks to access the
Internet for outside business interests.


1.  Requirements

    1.  Secure remote access must be strictly controlled with encryption
        (i.e., Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)) and strong pass-phrases.
        For further information see the *Acceptable Encryption Policy*
        and the *Password Policy*.

    1.  Authorized Users shall protect their login and password, even
        from family members.

    1.  While using a MailRoute-owned computer to remotely
        connect to MailRoute's corporate network, Authorized
        Users shall ensure the remote host is not connected to any other
        network at the same time, with the exception of personal
        networks that are under their complete control or under the
        complete control of an Authorized User or Third Party.

    1.  Use of external resources to conduct MailRoute business
        must be approved in advance by InfoSec and the appropriate
        business unit manager.

    1.  All hosts that are connected to MailRoute internal
        networks via remote access technologies must use the most
        up-to-date anti-virus software (place url to corporate software
        site here), this includes personal computers. Third party
        connections must comply with requirements as stated in the
        *Third Party Agreement*.

    1.  Personal equipment used to connect to MailRoute\'s
        networks must meet the requirements of MailRoute-owned
        equipment for remote access as stated in the *Hardware and
        Software Configuration Standards for Remote Access to MailRoute Networks*.
