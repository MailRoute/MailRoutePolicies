# Remote Access Tools Policy

**Last Update Status:** *Updated August 2020*

## Overview

Remote desktop software, also known as remote access tools, provide a
way for computer users and support staff alike to share screens, access
work computer systems from home, and vice versa. Examples of such
software include LogMeIn, GoToMyPC, VNC (Virtual Network Computing), and
Windows Remote Desktop (RDP).Â  While these tools can save significant
time and money by eliminating travel and enabling collaboration, they
also provide a back door into the MailRoute network that can be
used for theft of, unauthorized access to, or destruction of assets. As
a result, only approved, monitored, and properly controlled remote
access tools may be used on MailRoute computer systems.

## Purpose

This policy defines the requirements for remote access tools used at
MailRoute

## Scope

This policy applies to all remote access where either end of the
communication terminates at a MailRoute computer asset

## Policy

All remote access tools used to communicate between MailRoute
assets and other systems must comply with the following policy
requirements.

1. Remote Access Tools

    MailRoute provides mechanisms to collaborate between internal
users, with external partners, and from non-MailRoute systems.
The approved software list can be obtained from
\<link-to-approved-remote-access-software-list\>. Because proper
configuration is important for secure use of these tools, mandatory
configuration procedures are provided for each of the approved tools.

    The approved software list may change at any time, but the following
requirements will be used for selecting approved products:

    -  All remote access tools or systems that allow communication to
    MailRoute resources from the Internet or external partner
    systems must require multi-factor authentication. Examples include
    authentication tokens and smart cards that require an additional PIN
    or password.

    -  The authentication database source must be Active Directory or LDAP,
    and the authentication protocol must involve a challenge-response
    protocol that is not susceptible to replay attacks. The remote
    access tool must mutually authenticate both ends of the session.

    -  Remote access tools must support the MailRoute application
    layer proxy rather than direct connections through the perimeter
    firewall(s).

    -  Remote access tools must support strong, end-to-end encryption of
    the remote access communication channels as specified in the
    MailRoute network encryption protocols policy.

    -  All MailRoute antivirus, data loss prevention, and other
    security systems must not be disabled, interfered with, or
    circumvented in any way.

All remote access tools must be purchased through the standard MailRoute
procurement process, and the information technology group must
approve the purchase.
