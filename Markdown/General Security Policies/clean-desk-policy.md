# Clean Desk Policy

**Last Update Status:** *Updated August 2020*

## Overview

A clean desk policy can be an import tool to ensure that all
sensitive/confidential materials are removed from an end user workspace
and locked away when the items are not in use or an employee leaves
his/her workstation. It is one of the top strategies to utilize when
trying to reduce the risk of security breaches in the workplace. Such a
policy can also increase employee's awareness about protecting sensitive
information.

## Purpose

The purpose for this policy is to establish the minimum requirements for
maintaining a "clean desk" -- where sensitive/critical information about
our employees, our intellectual property, our customers and our vendors
is secure in locked areas and out of site. A Clean Desk policy is not
only ISO 27001/17799 compliant, but it is also part of standard basic
privacy controls.

## Scope

This policy applies to all MailRoute employees and affiliates.

## Policy

1.  Employees are required to ensure that all sensitive/confidential
    information in hardcopy or electronic form is secure in their
    work area at the end of the day and when they are expected to be
    gone for an extended period.

1.  Computer workstations must be locked when workspace is
    unoccupied.

1.  Computer workstations must be shut completely down at the end of
    the work day.

1.  Any Restricted or Sensitive information must be removed from the
    desk and locked in a drawer when the desk is unoccupied and at
    the end of the work day.

1.  File cabinets containing Restricted or Sensitive information
    must be kept closed and locked when not in use or when not
    attended.

1.  Keys used for access to Restricted or Sensitive information must
    not be left at an unattended desk.

1.  Laptops must be either locked with a locking cable or locked
    away in a drawer.

1.  Passwords may not be left on sticky notes posted on or under a
    computer, nor may they be left written down in an accessible
    location.

1.  Printouts containing Restricted or Sensitive information should
    be immediately removed from the printer.

1. Upon disposal Restricted and/or Sensitive documents should be
    shredded in the official shredder bins or placed in the lock
    confidential disposal bins.

1. Whiteboards containing Restricted and/or Sensitive information
    should be erased.

1. Lock away portable computing devices such as laptops and
    tablets.

1. Treat mass storage devices such as CDROM, DVD or USB drives as
    sensitive and secure them in a locked drawer

1. All printers and fax machines should be cleared of papers as soon as
they are printed; this helps ensure that sensitive documents are not
left in printer trays for the wrong person to pick up.
