# Acceptable Use Policy

**Last Update Status:** *Updated August 2020*

## Overview

Infosec's intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use Policy are not to
impose restrictions that are contrary to MailRoute's established culture
of openness, trust and integrity. Infosec is committed to protecting
MailRoute's employees, partners and the company from illegal or
damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.

Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to
computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network
accounts providing electronic mail, WWW browsing, and FTP, are the
property of MailRoute. These systems are to be used for business
purposes in serving the interests of the company, and of our clients and
customers in the course of normal operations. Please review Human
Resources policies for further details.

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and
support of every MailRoute employee and affiliate who deals with
information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of
every computer user to know these guidelines, and to conduct their
activities accordingly.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer
equipment at MailRoute. These rules are in place to protect the employee
and MailRoute. Inappropriate use exposes MailRoute to risks including
virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal
issues.

## Scope

This policy applies to the use of information, electronic and computing
devices, and network resources to conduct MailRoute business or interact
with internal networks and business systems, whether owned or leased by
MailRoute, the employee, or a third party. All employees, contractors,
consultants, temporary, and other workers at MailRoute and its
subsidiaries are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding
appropriate use of information, electronic devices, and network
resources in accordance with MailRoute policies and standards, and local
laws and regulation. Exceptions to this policy are documented in section
"Policy"

This policy applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries,
and other workers at MailRoute, including all personnel affiliated with
third parties. This policy applies to all equipment that is owned or
leased by MailRoute.

## Policy

1.  **General Use and Ownership**

     1. MailRoute proprietary information stored on electronic and computing devices whether owned or leased by MailRoute, the employee or a third party, remains the sole property of MailRoute. You must ensure through legal or technical means that proprietary information is protected in accordance with the *Data Protection Standard.*
 
     1. You have a responsibility to promptly report the theft, loss or unauthorized disclosure of MailRoute proprietary information.
 
     1. You may access, use or share MailRoute proprietary information only to the extent it is authorized and necessary to fulfill your assigned job duties.
 
     1. Employees are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness of personal use. Individual departments are responsible for creating guidelines concerning personal use of Internet/Intranet/Extranet systems. In the absence of such policies, employees should be guided by departmental policies on personal use, and if there is any uncertainty, employees should consult their supervisor or manager. 
 
     1. For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within MailRoute may monitor equipment, systems and network traffic at any time, per Infosec\'s *Audit Policy*. 
 
     1. MailRoute reserves the right to audit networks and systems on a periodic basis to ensure compliance with this policy. 

1.  **Security and Proprietary Information**

    1.  All mobile and computing devices that connect to the
        internal network must comply with the *Minimum Access
        Policy*.
    
    1.  System level and user level passwords must comply with the
        *Password Policy*. Providing access to another individual,

    1.  All computing devices must be secured with a
        password-protected screensaver with the automatic activation
        feature set to 10 minutes or less. You must lock the screen
        or log off when the device is unattended.
    
    1.  Postings by employees from a MailRoute email address to
        newsgroups should contain a disclaimer stating that the
        opinions expressed are strictly their own and not
        necessarily those of MailRoute, unless posting is in the
        course of business duties.
    
    1.  Employees must use extreme caution when opening e-mail
        attachments received from unknown senders, which may contain
        malware.

1.  **Unacceptable Use**

    The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Employees may be
exempted from these restrictions during the course of their legitimate
job responsibilities (e.g., systems administration staff may have a need
to disable the network access of a host if that host is disrupting
production services).

    Under no circumstances is an employee of MailRoute authorized to engage
in any activity that is illegal under local, state, federal or
international law while utilizing MailRoute-owned resources.
